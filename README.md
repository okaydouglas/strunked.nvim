# strunked.nvim

A neovim plugin to convert romance words to saxon words in a document.

Strunk & White wrote a list of 15 reminders in *The Elements of Style*.

The 14th reminder, **Avoid fancy words** is excerpted here:

> **14. Avoid fancy words.**

> Avoid the elaborate, the pretentious, the coy, and the cute. Do not be
> tempted by a twenty-dollar word when there is a ten-center handy,
> ready and able. Anglo-Saxon is a livelier tongue than Latin, so use
> Anglo-Saxon words.

> If you admire fancy words , if every sky is *beauteous*, every blonde
> *curvaceous*, every intelligent child *prodigious*, if you are tickled by *dis-
> combobulate*, you will have a bad time with **Reminder 14**. What is
> wrong, you ask, with *beauteous*? No one knows, for sure. There is nothing
> wrong, really, with any word-all are good, but some are better than oth-
> ers. A matter of ear, a matter of reading the books that sharpen the ear.

This plugin identifies Latin based words in a document, and provides a list of Anglo-Saxon based suggestions to replace them with.

As elaborated in *The Elements of Style*:

>> In this, as in so many matters pertaining to style,
>> one's ear must be one's guide: *gut* is a lustier noun than *intestine*, but
>> the two words are not interchangeable, because *gut* is often inappropri-
>> ate, being too coarse for the context. Never call a stomach a tummy
>> without good reason.

Use discretion when deciding whether to use one of the suggested replacements.
